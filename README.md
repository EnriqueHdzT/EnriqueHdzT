## What Am I Doing Right Now?
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m currently working on my WEB CV page, school stuff and a very secret software (I don't wanna tease it, but if you're a Youtuber you gonna love it)
- ðŸ“‘ Iâ€™m currently learning some WEB backend development with node.js, express y mongoDB, as well as UML diagrams and general software documentation.
- ðŸŽ¨ I'm learning to sketch and draw as well, I have zero talent but still, really exited about it.
